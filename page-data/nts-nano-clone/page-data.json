Turns out Nano clones often use a replacement for the FT232 USB-to-serial chip called the CH340. These chips don’t have drivers on OSX High Sierra by default and the drivers provided by the clone manufacturer didn’t work for me.</p>\n<p>I eventually had to download drivers and follow the instructions from this <a href=\"https://github.com/adrianmihalko/ch340g-ch34g-ch34x-mac-os-x-driver\">Github</a> repo. Super sketchy and I probably have a virus now, but at least my Nano clone works.</p>\n<p>Switching from an Uno to a Nano I had to update my <code class=\"language-text\">platformio.ini</code> config:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"ini\"><pre class=\"language-ini\"><code class=\"language-ini\"><span class=\"token comment\">; before</span>\n<span class=\"token selector\">[env:uno]</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">platform</span> <span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> atmelavr</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">board</span> <span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> uno</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">framework</span> <span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> arduino</span>\n\n<span class=\"token comment\">; after</span>\n<span class=\"token selector\">[env:nanoatmega328new]</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">platform</span> <span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> atmelavr</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">board</span> <span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> nanoatmega328new</span>\n<span class=\"token constant\">framework</span> <span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span> arduino</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>There were some people who said to use the old bootloader, but that didn’t work for me.
